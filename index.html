          The holy town of Vrindavan, near Mathura is an important pilgrimage hub in Braj region that attracts an
          estimated 5,00,000 pilgrims every year. This is the place where Lord Krishna is believed to have spent his
          childhood. The name of Vrindavan comes from words 'vrinda', which means basil, and 'van' meaning forest. In
          this particular instance, the forest being referred to is believed to be either Nidhivan or Seva Kunj. Here,
          devotees are seen smearing dust on their forehead as it is considered to be sacred. There is a veritable
          treasure trove of beautiful temples dedicated to Lord Krishna in Vrindavan, the likes of which include Banke
          Bihari, ISKCON, Gopeshwar Mahadev, Shahji, and Govinddeo among others.

      <h3 style="color: rgb(74,79,158);">History of Vrindavan</h3>
      <div>
        Vrindavan has an ancient past, associated with Hindu culture and history, and was established in the 16th and
        17th centuries as a result of an explicit treaty between Muslims and Hindu Emperors,[24] and is an important
        Hindu pilgrimage site since long.

        In contemporary times, Vallabha Charya, aged eleven visited Vrindavan. Later on, he performed three pilgrimages
        of India, barefoot giving discourses on Bhagavad Gita at 84 places. These 84 places are known as Pushtimarg
        Baithak and since then have the places of pilgrimage. Yet, he stayed in Vrindavan for four months each year.
        Vrindavan thus heavily influenced his formation of Pushtimarg.Banke Bihari Temple, vrindavan
        The essence of Vrindavan was lost over time until the 16th century when it was rediscovered by Chaitanya
        Mahaprabhu. In the year 1515, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu visited Vrindavan, with the purpose of locating the lost holy
        places associated with Krishna's life.[25]In the last 250 years, the extensive forests of Vrindavan have been
        subjected to urbanisation, first by local
        Rajas and in recent decades by apartment developers. The forest cover has been whittled away to only a few
        remaining spots, and the local wildlife, including peacocks, cows, monkeys and a variety of bird species has
        been virtually eliminated.

          <h6>The festivals of Vrindavan are unique, colorful events almost always involving ‘Raas’ or singing and
            dancing, the throwing of colors and eating several sweetmeats. The grandest festival, however, is the Holi
            festival or the festival of colors that virtually provokes everybody to lose all inhibitions and immerse
            themselves in the multifarious presence of the Lord. The significance of Holi is such that in some temples
            colored water is sprayed continuously all the year around and that too with a fervor matched with the
            devout passion of the devotees. One of the best places to see the enact of ‘gokul’s’ holi celebration is
            at the Gulal Kund of Braj. Here the young boys and girls form into troupes and dance the ‘Raas’ throughout
            the day and night regaling the audiences with the episodes from the life of the young Krishna depicting
            him as a mischievous and naughty yet very friendly and loving person.</h6>

          <h3>Govardhan Puja Vrindavan</h3>
          <h6>
            Another one of these are Govardhan Puja, when he had lifted the massive Govardhan Parwat or mountain on
            his little finger and protected the entire clans and animals of Gokul under its protective umbrella from
            the rabid onslaught of the stormy weather. When the elders of Krishna’s village under his persuasion begin
            worshipping the ‘Goverdhan parvat’ rather than Indra for rains, Krishna himself attained a huge form as
            the ‘Giriraj’ and accepted all their offerings. This festival is also called Annakoot. When he learned about
            this, Indra became furious and unleashed a torrential downpour upon Vrindavan. To protect the residents,
            Lord Krishna lifted the entire Govardhan Hill on his little finger, providing a shelter for the people and
            animals.
